				<hr>
				<p>We take our coffee very seriously, so not only does it taste great, but we also make sure we buy from suppliers that look after both their workers and the environment.

				Our coffee beans are sourced from all over the world and from many different farms of all types and sizes â€“ large plantations, co-operative groups and tiny family farms. This means that there is no one size fits all approach to buying responsibly, but we are focused on promoting sustainable farming and a better outcome for all.
